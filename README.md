# NodeNetwork
Simple Node network for testing neo4j as a simulation backend


Its just a simple node relationship simulation thing I wanted to do to get a better handle on neo4j for my college.
Going to have nodes that are things "knowledge" and the relationships are going to be a classifyer like thing is thing (with the things being nodes) and the is being the relationship edge.
along with two propertys tied to it, short term float, long term float. Im going to run a simulation in unity (simplest for getting some nice visuals going) and decay the short term nodes and warm up relationship floats as it trys to 'remember'
